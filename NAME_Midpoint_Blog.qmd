### What have you been learning so far?

-   <span style="color: green;">I'm currently working on an AI & Housing project in the DSPG program, and it's been a great learning experience.I've been improving my programming skills in Python, learning how to process images, and exploring data. I also started using PyTorch, which is helping me understand more about how AI works.

-   <span style="color: green;">Another cool tool I’ve been using is the leaflet package. It lets us turn data into maps that you can interact with. We’re trying to combine these maps with AI to make them even more user-friendly.

-   <span style="color: green;">Alongside Python, I've been picking up some skills in R programming. This has been a new area for me, and I’ve enjoyed learning how to create blogs in R and getting to know my way around RStudio.

-   <span style="color: green;">I’m excited about all these new skills because they help me do more with technology and make things easier for others to understand.

### Demonstrate some of the work from your learning.

-   


### New Directions in Learning

- <span style="color: orange;">During the program,I've been learning about new technology, which is important for my future. AI is a big part of this, and I’m excited because it’s something that can really help in many jobs today.


### Skills I Want to Improve

- <span style="color: orange;">For the rest of the program, I want to get better at using Python and working with AI. I also want to be better at making maps from data. These skills will help me do my projects better and faster. I also want to work on being a good team player and communicating well with others.

### Am I Meeting My Goals?

- <span style="color: orange;">Yes, I think I am. When I started this program, I set some goals for what I wanted to learn and do. So far, I feel like I'm on the right path and making good progress. I’m using what I learn, and I'm excited to keep going and learn more.

## Before Submitting Your Assignment

-   Please update everything except the `categories: ["Midpoint Reflection"]` in the YAML metadata section of your `NAME_Midpoint_Blog.qmd` file.
-   Replace the `NAME` section of the `NAME_Midpoint_Blog.qmd` file with your first name.
-   If you are including any images, place them in the `imgs\` folder and follow the guidelines discussed in the [Blog Writing Guidelines post](add%20link) for adding images.
    -   The same practice holds for data to be in the `data` folder.
-   Render the blog post locally on your device to make sure that it can render correctly. If you are in RStudio, you can use the Render icon or hit `Ctrl+Shift+K` on Windows and `Shift-Command-K` on Mac.

## Using Python Code Chunks

If you are using python in your code chunks you will need to run the following at the top of your code, after the library imports. Set the following chunks to `eval=TRUE`.

```{r}
# Library for running python code in RStudio.
library(reticulate)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Check for virtual environment, if it doesn't exist, create the venv, if it exists
# then use the venv called "r-python"

if (virtualenv_exists("r-python")) {
  use_virtualenv("r-python")
} else {
  virtualenv_create("r-python")
  use_virtualenv("r-python")
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Installing dependencies for the python virtualenv

virtualenv_install(envname = "r-python", packages = c("numpy", "pandas", "scikit-learn"), all = TRUE)
```
